## 1 Introduction
The `SeetaFace2` face recognition engine includes three core modules required to build a fully automated face recognition system: face detection module `FaceDetector`, facial key positioning module `FaceLandmarker` and face feature extraction and Compare the module `FaceRecognizer`. There will be additional auxiliary modules such as open source face tracking and closed eye detection.

`SeetaFace2` is developed in standard C++. All modules do not depend on any third-party libraries and support x86 architecture (Windows, Linux) and ARM architecture (Android). The top applications supported by SeetaFace2 include, but are not limited to, face access, insensitivity, face matching, and the like.

SeetaFace2 is a milestone version for face recognition business. The face detection module can achieve more than 92% recall rate under 100 false detection conditions on FDDB. Face key point positioning supports 5 points and 81 points positioning. A face recognition application that supports thousands of people's base libraries than the N module.


Modules | Method Overview | Basic Specifications | Typical Platform Speed
-----|---------|-------------|------------
** Face Detection** | Cascaded CNN | FDDB has a recall rate of 92% (100 false detections). 40 Minimal Face <br>I7: 70FPS(1920x1080)<br>RK3399: 25FPS(640x480)
** Facial closure point positioning (81 points and 5 points)** | FEC-CNN | Average positioning error (normalized according to the center distance between the two eyes)<br>0.069 on the 300-W Challenge Set. | I7: 450FPS and 500FPS<br>RK3399: 110FPS and 220FPS
**Face feature extraction and comparison** | ResNet50 | Recognition: In the general 1:N+1 scenario, when the error acceptance rate is 1%, <br>1000 base library, the preferred recognition rate is over 98%,<br> The 5,000-person base library has a preferred recognition rate of over 95%. | I7: 8FPS<br>RK3399: 2.5FPS

Compared to the 2016 open source `SeetaFace 1.0`, `SeetaFace2` has an order of magnitude improvement in both speed and accuracy.

  - Parameter Description: https://developer.android.google.cn/ndk/guides/cmake
    + ANDROID_ABI: The following values can be taken:
       Goal ABI. If the target ABI is not specified, CMake uses armeabi-v7a by default.
       Valid ABI are:
      - armeabi：CPU with software floating point arithmetic based on ARMv5TE
      - armeabi-v7a：ARMv7-based device with hardware FPU instructions (VFP v3 D16)
      - armeabi-v7a with NEON：Same as armeabi-v7a, but with NEON floating point instructions enabled. This is equivalent to setting -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a and -DANDROID_ARM_NEON=ON.
      - arm64-v8a：ARMv8 AArch64 Instruction Set
      - x86：IA-32 Instruction Set
      - x86_64 - x86-64 Instruction Set
    + ANDROID_NDK <path> The path of installed ndk in host
    + ANDROID_PLATFORM: For a full list of platform names and corresponding Android system images, see the [Android NDK Native API] (https://developer.android.google.com/ndk/guides/stable_apis.html)
    + ANDROID_ARM_MODE
    + ANDROID_ARM_NEON
    + ANDROID_STL:Specifies the STL that CMake should use. 

### 2.4 IOS platfrom
> example IOS device.

+ Dependence
  - One PC within MacOS.
  - Source code from `git`

+ Command lines
  + Use `cmake` compile and install
    ```
    cd SeetaFace2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    chmod +x ../ios/cmake.sh
    ../ios/cmake.sh -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/install
    make -j4
    make install
    ```

    After all commands above succeed, libraries would install into `SeetaFace2/build/install`.

  + Compile for simlulator.
    Change `cmake` parameters like: `../ios/cmake.sh -DIOS_PLATFORM=SIMULATOR64 -DPLATFORM=x64`

  + See `<root>/ios/cmake.sh` and `<root>/ios/iOS.cmake` for more compilation controls.

## 5. example Description
The `example/search/example.cpp` example shows a simple and complete process for face recognition, including: 1. Pre-registered images in the face-to-face recognition base library (the default registration in the example is "1" .jpg "Face in the face"; 2. Turn on the camera to detect the face in the camera screen; 3. Identify the detected face and determine the identity of the face.

If the tester wants to successfully identify his face in the bottom library, he needs to add the image named after his own name (name + .jpg) in the bottom register registration list of example.cpp, and copy the image file named by his own name. Go to the program's running directory, recompile example and run the program to test the recognition effect.
